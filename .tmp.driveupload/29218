# Introduction {#sec1}

Child Malnutrition remains a dominant public health challenge globally. In 2022, for instance, about 148.1 million (22.3%) children below 5 years were stunted, whereas 45 million (6.8%) and 37 million (5.6%) were wasted and overweight, respectively [@who2023]. While there has been some progress in the actualization of the global nutrition targets, this progress is slow, and the levels of malnutrition continue to persist. Africa and Asia account for almost half the world’s child malnutrition burden [@who2023].

In the East African region, stunting prevalence (32.6%) was higher than the global average (22.3%), whereas wasting and overweight were 5.2% and 4.0%, respectively [@IEG2022]. With the possibility of suffering from more than one form of malnutrition, children remain largely susceptible to the perilous effects posed by this condition. According to nutrition statistics, 3.62% of all children under the age of five years (15.95 million) have been reported as being both stunted and wasted, whereas 1.87% of all children (8.23 million) have been reported to experience both stunting and overweight globally [@global].

In the first half of 2022, Kenya reported about 942,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children between 6 and 59 months [@Bhavnani2023]. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) [@KNBSICF2023], 18% of children under 5 are stunted (chronically undernourished), 5% are wasted (acutely malnourished), whereas 3% and 10% are overweight and underweight, respectively.  While Kenya has substantially reduced the burden of child malnutrition, undernutrition is estimated to cost the country over US$38.3 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) following losses in workforce labor and productivity for 2010–2030 [@USAID2018]. 

Malnutrition denotes “a state of nutrition in which a deficiency, or an excess, of energy, protein, and micronutrient causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/ body form (body shape, size, and composition), function, and clinical outcome” [@stratton2003]. Malnutrition has been attributed to several diverse interlinked factors with detrimental short and long-term effects [@Pelletier1995; @Pelletier2003]. Not only does it affect the physical and cognitive development of a child, but it also drastically increases their risk of infections and contributes negatively to their mortality and morbidity [@Rice2000; @jonah2018; @victora2008; @kar2008; @mendez1999; @walker2015; @rabbani2016].

Stunting, underweight, and wasting remain the recommended three indicators of malnutrition [@jonah2018]. Stunting refers to low height for age and reflects the growth in linear terms achieved at the age at which the anthropometric measurements were taken. Underweight is low weight for age, resulting from a short-term lack of food. In contrast, wasting is severe undernutrition resulting from inadequate food intake and infections [@jonah2018]. In children under 5 years, stunting is the most significant measure of overall health and well-being capable of highlighting salient social disparities [@deOnis2016]. Moreover, because stunting measures linear growth in children, it is considered an accurate measure of malnutrition in the long term due to its insensitivity to variations in food consumption [@Hoddinott2013; @Zere2003]. 

## Socioeconomic disparities in child malnutrition

Kenya is classified as a middle-income country based on its Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Under this classification frame, countries are classified into three categories based on their income as either low, middle, or high-income countries [@jonah2018]. A country's attainment of the middle-income classification status is often seen as an indication of progress resulting from such activities as heightened investments across all government sectors and improved productivity. Shifts in a country's classification from low to middle, then to high income, indicate economic advancement. As expected of growth, such advancements are expected to impact the well-being of a country's population positively. For instance, economic advancements are expected to create employment opportunities, translating into increased disposable income, improved health, and education [@Bloom2004; @Ranis2000]. Improved living standards following economic advancement are expected to translate into exceptional and improved nutritional consequences for children and adults. 

The economic status associated with a country has been shown in previous studies to result in improved health status of a population [@Marmot2002; @Ettner1996]. However, economic advancement does not necessarily translate to equitable distribution of positive prospects across the population. Often, these tend to be skewed, with some groups benefiting more than others. 

Kenya has made commendable progress in reducing the burden of malnutrition as part of the Standard Development Goals (SDGs), which have considerably reduced the stunting rate. Even so, the overall prevalence of the condition remains larger than those observed for other forms of malnutrition [@jonah2018; @Haddad2015]. Given the danger malnutrition poses to child growth, survival, and well-being, its consequences are of substantial interest to the government, public health professionals, and policymakers. 

This study contributes significantly to the available knowledge on socioeconomic disproportions in the Kenyan child malnutrition burden, examining trends in stunting, underweight, and wasting across socioeconomic groups, geographical locations, and selected household, child, maternal, and paternal characteristics. We also examine the determinants of child malnutrition and employ standard procedures of inequality to quantify the trends [36] and decompose vicissitudes in the concentration indices to determine factors that drive socioeconomic disparities in child malnutrition in Kenya. The study utilizes current data from the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (DHS) (2014 to 2022) to comprehensively analyze the scope of the problem, specifically focusing on children below five years.
