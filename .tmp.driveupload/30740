# Introduction {#sec1}

Child Malnutrition remains a dominant public health challenge globally. In 2022, for instance, about 148.1 million (22.3%) children below 5 years were stunted, whereas 45 million (6.8%) and 37 million (5.6%) were wasted and overweight, respectively [@who2023]. While there has been some progress in the actualization of the global nutrition targets, this progress is slow, and the levels of malnutrition continue to persist. Africa and Asia account for almost half the world’s child malnutrition burden [@who2023].

In the East African region, stunting prevalence (32.6%) was higher than the global average (22.3%), whereas wasting and overweight were 5.2% and 4.0%, respectively [@IEG2022]. With the possibility of suffering from more than one form of malnutrition, children remain largely susceptible to the perilous effects posed by this condition. According to nutrition statistics, 3.62% of all children under the age of five years (15.95 million) have been reported as being both stunted and wasted, whereas 1.87% of all children (8.23 million) have been reported to experience both stunting and overweight globally [@global].

In the first half of 2022, Kenya reported about 942,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children between 6 and 59 months [@Bhavnani2023]. According to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) [@KNBSICF2023], 18% of children under 5 are stunted (chronically undernourished), 5% are wasted (acutely malnourished), whereas 3% and 10% are overweight and underweight, respectively.  While Kenya has substantially reduced the burden of child malnutrition, undernutrition is estimated to cost the country over US$38.3 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) following losses in workforce labor and productivity for 2010–2030 [@USAID2018]. 

Malnutrition denotes “a state of nutrition in which a deficiency, or an excess, of energy, protein, and micronutrient causes measurable adverse effects on tissue/ body form (body shape, size, and composition), function, and clinical outcome” [@stratton2003]. Malnutrition has been attributed to several diverse interlinked factors with detrimental short and long-term effects [@Pelletier1995; @Pelletier2003]. Not only does it affect the physical and cognitive development of a child, but it also drastically increases their risk of infections and contributes negatively to their mortality and morbidity [@Rice2000; @jonah2018; @victora2008; @kar2008; @mendez1999; @walker2015; @rabbani2016].

Stunting, underweight, and wasting remain the recommended three indicators of malnutrition [@jonah2018]. Stunting refers to low height for age and reflects the growth in linear terms achieved at the age at which the anthropometric measurements were taken. Underweight is low weight for age, resulting from a short-term lack of food. In contrast, wasting is severe undernutrition resulting from inadequate food intake and infections [@jonah2018]. In children under 5 years, stunting is the most significant measure of overall health and well-being capable of highlighting salient social disparities [@deOnis2016]. Moreover, because stunting measures linear growth in children, it is considered an accurate measure of malnutrition in the long term due to its insensitivity to variations in food consumption [@Hoddinott2013;@Zere2003]. 

## Socioeconomic disparities in child malnutrition

Kenya is classified as a middle-income country based on its Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Under this classification frame, countries are classified into three categories based on their income as either low, middle, or high-income countries [@jonah2018]. A country's attainment of the middle-income classification status is often seen as an indication of progress resulting from such activities as heightened investments across all government sectors and improved productivity. Shifts in a country's classification from low to middle, then to high income, indicate economic advancement. As expected of growth, such advancements are expected to impact the well-being of a country's population positively. For instance, economic advancements are expected to create employment opportunities, translating into increased disposable income, improved health, and education [@Bloom2004;@Ranis2000]. Improved living standards following economic advancement are expected to translate into exceptional and improved nutritional consequences for children and adults. 

The economic status associated with a country has been shown in previous studies to result in improved health status of a population [@Marmot2002; @Ettner1996]. However, economic advancement does not necessarily translate to equitable distribution of positive prospects across the population. Often, these tend to be skewed, with some groups benefiting more than others. 

Kenya has made commendable progress in reducing the burden of malnutrition as part of the Standard Development Goals (SDGs), which have considerably reduced the stunting rate. Even so, the overall prevalence of the condition remains larger than those observed for other forms of malnutrition [@jonah2018;@Haddad2015]. Given the danger malnutrition poses to child growth, survival, and well-being, its consequences are of substantial interest to the government, public health professionals, and policymakers. 

This study contributes significantly to the available knowledge on socioeconomic disproportions in the Kenyan child malnutrition burden, examining trends in stunting, underweight, and wasting across socioeconomic groups, geographical locations, and selected household, child, maternal, and paternal characteristics. We also examine the determinants of child malnutrition and employ standard procedures of inequality to quantify the trends [36] and decompose vicissitudes in the concentration indices to determine factors that drive socioeconomic disparities in child malnutrition in Kenya. The study utilizes current data from the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (DHS) (2014 to 2022) to comprehensively analyze the scope of the problem, specifically focusing on children below five years. 

# Methods {#sec11}

## Study data

We utilized data from the 2014 and 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) (standard DHS). These surveys adopted a two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach: clusters in the first stage and households in the second. In 2014, a response rate of 99% was achieved from 39,679 households, and in 2022, a 98% response rate from 38,731 occupied households [KNBSICF2015; @KNBSICF2023]. Analyses considered all live children (0-59 months) of interviewed mothers, excluding those with missing anthropometric data. The data was weighted for non-response and used with DHS authorization.

## Variables

### Outcome

Malnutrition was characterized by stunting (low height-for-age z-scores, HAZ), underweight (low weight-for-age z-scores, WAZ), and wasting (low weight-for-height z-scores, WHZ) [@kien_trends_2016; @jonah2018]. Stunting indicates a child's linear growth at a given age. Underweight results from short-term food deprivation, while wasting stems from both inadequate food intake and infections [@jonah2018].

In children under five, a HAZ, WAZ, or WHZ between -2 and -3 standard deviations (SD) below the median suggests moderate stunting, underweight, or wasting, respectively. Z-scores less than -3 SD below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) child growth standards median indicate severe conditions [@WHO2010]. 

We categorized children with HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ scores below -2 SD of the WHO growth standards median as stunted, underweight, or wasted, respectively. Notably, stunting in children under five highlights chronic undernutrition, whereas wasting and underweight can imply both acute and chronic malnutrition [@kien_trends_2016].

### Covariates {#covariates}

In this study, we considered a comprehensive set of determinants linked to child malnutrition. Child-specific variables included age (in months), gender, place and region of residence, delivery location, and birth order. At the household level, we accounted for characteristics such as religion and socioeconomic status. Maternal indicators included age, education level, and birth interval, while we also considered paternal education. These determinants are grounded in existing literature and were available in our data set [@jonah2018; @kien_trends_2016; @Farah2019].

## Statistical analysis

### Analysis of disparities in child malnutrition

The extent and trends of socioeconomic disparities in stunting, underweight, and wasting were quantified using concentration indices (CIs) estimated based on the corresponding z-scores [@odonnell_analyzing_2008; @Wagstaff1991; @Wagstaff2000]. Concentration indices quantify the socioeconomic disparities in a health variable and allow assessment of the extent and levels of disparities. CIs were computed as double the area between the concentration curve and the line of equality -- the $45^{\circ}$ line. 

According to O’Donnell et al. [@odonnell_analyzing_2008]:
\begin{equation}
CI = \frac{2}{\mu} \textrm{cov}(h, r)
\label{eq:one}
\end{equation}

In Equation \ref{eq:one}, $\mu$ is the average of malnutrition (stunting, underweight, and wasting) in children under five children, $h$ denotes observation-specific child malnutrition, and $r$ is the rank of the socioeconomic status of a household. The CI of a given health variable usually takes values between -1 and +1, with 0 suggesting perfect equity of the health variable between the poorest and the richest socioeconomic groups. Negative values suggest a higher concentration of malnutrition among the poorest group, and positive values suggest a higher concentration of inequity among the richest socioeconomic group [@Akombi2019;@jonah2018;@kien_trends_2016; @Wagstaff2000]. As in Kien et al. [@kien_trends_2016], the continuous forms of the variables for stunting, underweight, and wasting were employed to enhance precision. 

### Analysis of determinants of child malnutrition

Determinants of child malnutrition were investigated using binary logistic regression. Separate models were fitted for stunting, underweight, and wasting. Odds ratios were computed for each adjustment covariate to examine associations between the child malnutrition indicators and each explanatory variable in \ref{covariates}. Results from the fitted logistic regression models were used in the construction and decomposition of the Wagstaff normalized CIs described in \ref{decompose}.

### Decomposition of socioeconomic inequities in child malnutrition {#decompose}

Contributions of the determinants of malnutrition in children under five to the observed socioeconomic disparities were examined through a decomposition analysis. These decompositions were restricted to stunting and underweight, indicators that exhibited substantial differences between 2014 and 2022. This analysis framework utilized categorical forms of the response variables.

We considered a linear regression model where the response variable ($y$) is modeled as a linear combination of the $k$ determinants ($X_k$) as:
\begin{equation}
y = \alpha + \sum_{k} \beta_k X_k + \epsilon
\label{eq:two}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_k$ denotes the coefficient of $X_k$ (the set of explanatory variables) and $\epsilon$ is the error term. 

In terms of the CI for the response $y$, \ref{eq:two} reduces to:
\begin{equation}
CI = \sum_{k} \left( \frac{\beta_k \bar{X}_k}{\mu} \right) CI_k + \frac{G CI_{\epsilon}}{\mu}
\label{eq:three}
\end{equation}
where  $\mu$ denotes the average of $y$, $\bar{X}_k$ denotes the mean of the $k^{th}$ variable, $\beta_k$ denotes the coefficient of each determinant, $CI_k$ denotes the CI of each of the regressors in the model, and $G CI_\epsilon$ denotes the generalized concentration index for the error term, $\epsilon$. 

Equation \ref{eq:three} has two components: the explained $\left( (\beta_k \bar{X}_k)/ \mu)CI_k\right)$ and the unexplained component ($GCI_{\epsilon}/ \mu$). $(\beta_k \bar{X}_k)/\mu$ is the elasticity --the effect of each $CI_k $ on the overall CI of the outcome variable, $y$ [@Wagstaff2000;@Wagstaff2003]. 

We employed the Wagstaff normalization technique for CI values and used total differential decomposition to decipher the determinants' contribution to CI variations. This decomposition follows from Wagstaff et al. [@Wagstaff2003]. It permits approximation of the effects of child malnutrition disparities on variations in regression coefficients, variations in means of malnutrition determinants, and variations in the extent of inequity in child malnutrition determinants. These decompositions were applied to height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores. 

The formula for the decomposition applied was:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
dC & = \text{-}\frac{c}{\mu}d\alpha + \sum_{k}\frac{\bar{X}_k}{\mu} \left( CI_k \text{–} CI\right)d\beta_k \\
& + \sum_{k} \frac{\beta_k}{\mu} \left( CI_k \text{-} CI\right)d \bar{X}_k + \sum_{k} \frac{\beta_k \bar{X}_k}{\mu} dCI_k + d\frac{GCI}{\mu}{\epsilon}
\end{split}
\label{eq:four}
\end{equation}
where $dC$ denotes the overall change in the CI, $d\alpha$ constant value, $d\beta_k$ the coefficients of the determinants, $d\bar{X}_k$ mean values of the determinants, $dCI_k$ determinant-specific CI and $d((GCI)/\mu)_{\epsilon}$,  the error term [@Wagstaff2003].
